# Robotic Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) on the Intel Dataset

This is the repository for implementing Occupancy Grid Mapping (OGM) using Python. 

## Usage

There are four types of OGM I have implemented. 

1. Discrete Counting Sensor Model
2. Continuous Counting Sensor Model
3. Discrete Semantic Counting Sensor Model
4. Continuous Semantic Counting Sensor Model

Clone this repository. Navigate to the folder and run the following command in the terminal:

```
python run.py --task_num TASK_NUM
```

TASK_NUM is the number of the task which you want to run.
